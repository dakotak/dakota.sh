# Hello, I am Dakota
I am a _DevOps Engineer_ with a passion for technology and automation.

Throughout my 15 years in the technology industry, I've held various titles but always pursued the same goal: creating solutions with technology to solve real problems. I have a particular passion for automation because I believe humans are better suited for creative tasks, while repetitive processes are mundane and prone to error.
