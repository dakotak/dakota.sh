# Hello, I am Dakota
I am a _DevOps Engineer_ with a passion for technology, and automation.

I've had many titles throughout my 15 years of working in technology. Despite the many different titles, I have always done the same thing: create solutions with technology to solve real problems. I especially have a passion for automation, mostly because I believe that humans are better used in more creative work, and that humans following a repetitive process is mundane and error-prone.
